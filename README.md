### The "pipex" project challenges participants to implement a program that simulates the functionality of a shell command pipeline. This project dives into the intricacies of process management, file descriptors, and command execution, offering a practical exploration of Unix-like systems.

### Key Points:

**Shell Command Pipeline**: Participants are tasked with creating a program that emulates the behavior of a shell command pipeline. This involves executing a sequence of commands and directing the output of one command as the input to another.

**File Redirection**: The project requires a solid understanding of file descriptors and file redirection. Participants implement functionality to redirect the input and output of commands to and from files, mimicking the behavior of shell commands.

**Process Management**: Efficient process creation and management are crucial. Participants use system calls like fork(), execve(), and waitpid() to create and execute processes and handle their termination.

**Error Handling**: Robust error handling is emphasized, as participants must account for various potential issues, such as failed command execution, file access errors, and other runtime issues.

**Environment Manipulation**: Participants may be required to manipulate the environment variables for the commands being executed within the pipeline.

### Methodology:
The project encourages participants to follow a structured approach, parsing and analyzing the command pipeline, managing file descriptors, and creating and executing processes. It promotes a deep understanding of system calls and Unix-like operating system functionality.

### Assessment:
Evaluation is based on the accurate implementation of the command pipeline, proper handling of file redirection, and effective process management. Attention to error handling, adherence to project specifications, and code organization contribute to the overall assessment.

The "pipex" project provides participants with hands-on experience in creating a program that mimics the behavior of shell command pipelines. It delves into the intricacies of process management and file manipulation, offering a practical exploration of fundamental concepts in Unix-like systems programming.
